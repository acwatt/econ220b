Matteo: Gene patents and using examiner 

Q: If there is hetergeneity among examiners' ability, then this will have some implications for the Judge IV... what's the connection?

Can we construct another IV? Can we condition on the estimated alpha ability bins? Grady: that might create a lot of IV's and we know that IV behaves poorly with too many instruments compared to observations.
